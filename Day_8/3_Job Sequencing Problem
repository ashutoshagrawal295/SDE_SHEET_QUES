#Given a set of N jobs where each jobi has a deadline and profit associated with it.Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time.
 We earn the profit associated with job if and only if the job is completed by its deadline.Find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit.
 Note: Jobs will be given in the form (Jobid, Deadline, Profit) associated with that Job.
 
 ##Approach 1
 
class Solution 
{
    public:
    vector<int> JobScheduling(Job arr[], int n) 
    { 
        int ans=0,c=0,a[100]={0};
        sort(arr,arr+n,[](Job a,Job b){return a.profit>b.profit;});
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
             int j=arr[i].dead-1;
            while(j>=0&&a[j])
            {
                j--;
            }
            if(j>=0)
            {
                ans+=arr[i].profit;
                c++;
                a[j]=1;
            }
        }
        vector<int> v={c,ans};
        return v;
    } 
};

 **Time Complexity- O(n*n)
 **Space Complexity- O(n)
