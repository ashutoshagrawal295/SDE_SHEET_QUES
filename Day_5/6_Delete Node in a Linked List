#Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will be given access to the node(not a tail node) to be deleted directly.

##Approach 1

class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* t) {
    t->val = t->next->val;
    t->next = t->next->next;
    }
};

**Time Complexity- O(1)
**Space Complexity- O(1)
